# ClassicSnake-C

Welcome to the ClassicSnake-C repository! This project brings back the charm of the classic snake game in a terminal-based environment using the C programming language. Relive the nostalgia of early gaming while exploring the world of C coding.

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay**: Navigate a snake on the screen, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls and your own tail.

- **Terminal-based Interface**: The game boasts an ASCII-based interface, harking back to the simplicity of early gaming graphics.

- **Responsive Controls**: Direct the snake's movement using arrow keys for smooth and prompt control.

- **Scoring System**: Keep track of your progress with an in-game scoring system, challenging yourself to beat your best score.

- **Dynamic Food Placement**: Enjoy randomized food placement, adding a strategic element to the game.

- **Collision Detection**: Solid collision detection ensures a fair gameplay experience. Collide with walls or your tail, and it's game over.

- **Game Over Screen**: Receive a clear "Game Over" message alongside your final score upon completion.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:


2. Compile the source code using a C compiler. For example, using `gcc`:


3. Run the compiled executable:


4. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement: Up (↑), Down (↓), Left (←), Right (→).

5. Enjoy the game and aim for the highest score!

## Acknowledgements

- This game was inspired by the classic snake game found on early mobile phones and computer systems.

Have fun and happy coding!
